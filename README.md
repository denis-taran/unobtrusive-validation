# Unobtrusive validation library without dependencies

This small package allows you to add validation properties to HTML tags without writing any client-side code.

The library is compatible with unobtrusive validation library used in ASP.NET, but it doesn't require JQuery library.

Use the following command to install the library:

    npm install --save-dev unobtrusive-validation

If you don't use NPM, just include `index.min.js` into your HTML file and it should work out of the box.
